[h1]Starting option for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2999925713]Ares at War[/url][/h1]
This only works with Ares at War.


[h3]Sanbox mode[/h3]
Here you will be able to spawn on all planets in the Ares System. The space option only spawns near station 27, I plant to make it spawn every where in the belt.
