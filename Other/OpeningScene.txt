Hey [Player's Name],

I thought I’d do some research for you once you arrive in the Ares System. 

Well, it makes me wonder why you even chose to go to this place, especially after what we went through during the war youknow.

I understand, I really do – the need for a fresh start, the call of something new. But I can’t help but worry.

You’ll find the all research in the datapad, along with some credits I could spare.

I’m heading to Planet 26. It’s... quiet. Safe, they say. I wish I could be there with you, to watch your back like old times.

Take care of yourself, my friend.
